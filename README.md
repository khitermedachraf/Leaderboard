# Project Name : Leaderboard. 

>The leaderboard website displays scores submitted by different players. It also allows you to submit your score. All data is preserved thanks to the external Leaderboard API service.

> In this project, I will build a simple leaderboard dynamic page. The app will be styled according to the specifications listed later in this lesson. This simple web page will be built using webpack and served by a webpack dev server.

## Project requirements 🕜

You will be building the leaderboard website during the whole week. Here is the list of projects that will guide you through the steps described above. You will find details about each of the milestone requirements in the upcoming program activities.

- Project 1: basic page structure.
  - IMPORTANT NOTE This is the first time you will use Gitflow. Keep that in mind!
  - Create an npm project with webpack. (If you need a refresher, check the previous project or webpack exercise).
  - Write plain HTML markup with minimum styling (just to make the layout), because you will implement styles in the following steps. Use the above wireframe as a guide.
- Project 2: send and receive data from API.
  - Read the [Leaderboard API documentation](https://www.notion.so/microverse/Leaderboard-API-service-24c0c3c116974ac49488d4eb0267ade3) to learn how to use this API.
  - Create a new game with the name of your choice by using the API.
  - Implement the "Refresh" button (receiving data from the API and parsing the JSON).
  - Implement the form "Submit" button (sending data to the API).
  - Use `async` and `await` JavaScript features to consume the API.
  - No styling is required.
- Project 3: final touches.
